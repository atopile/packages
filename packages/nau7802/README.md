# NAU7802 Dual-Channel Thermocouple / Load Cell Amplifier

The Nuvoton NAU7802 is a precision low-power 24-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), with an
onboard low-noise programmable gain amplifier (PGA), onboard RC or Crystal oscillator, and a
precision 24-bit sigma-delta (Σ-Δ) analog to digital converter (ADC). The NAU7802 device is capable of
up to 23-bit ENOB (Effective Number Of Bits) performance. This device provides a complete front-end
solution for bridge/sensor measurement such as in weigh scales, strain gauges, and many other high
resolution, low sample rate applications.
